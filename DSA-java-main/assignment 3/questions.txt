Question 1: How many times 'Hello' is printed?
public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for(int i=0; i<5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Hello");
            i+=2;
        }
    }
}

Question 2: Write a program that reads a set of integers, and then prints the sum of the even and odd integers.

Question 3: Write a program to find the factorial of any number entered by the user. (Hint: factorial of a number n = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) * …… * 1 and exists for positive numbers only. We write factorial as n! So, factorial of 0! = 1, 1! = 1, 2! = 2, 3! = 6, 4! = 24 and so on. Note - Please do not confuse factorial with NOT EQUAL TO operator, they are not the same)

Question 4: Write a program to print the multiplication table of a number N, entered by the user.

Question 5: What is wrong in the following program?
public class Solution {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        for(int i = 0; i <= 5; i++ ) {
            System.out.println("i = " + i );
        }

        System.out.println("i after the loop = " + i );
    }
}
